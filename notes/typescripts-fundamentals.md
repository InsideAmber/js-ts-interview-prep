## 1. Why use TypeScript over JavaScript?

**1. Type Safety (Prevent Runtime Errors at Compile Time)**
JavaScript Issue:

JavaScript doesn't check types. You may pass a string where a number is expected and it won‚Äôt complain until runtime.

```ts
function square(num) {
  return num * num;
}

square("5"); // Returns "55" ü§Ø instead of 25
```

TypeScript Fix:

```ts
function square(num: number): number {
  return num * num;
}

square("5"); // ‚ùå Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
```
*TypeScript helps catch bugs before they happen by checking types during development. It acts like a safety net.*

2. Better Developer Experience (Autocompletion + IntelliSense)

TypeScript understands your code better ‚Üí IDEs like VSCode give:

- Autocomplete

- Inline documentation

- Real-time error checking

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const user: User = { name: "Amber", age: 25 };

// When you type: user. ‚Üê It shows name & age suggestions
```
*It increases productivity and reduces human error ‚Äî even in large teams and codebases.*

3. Scalability ‚Äî Easier to Maintain Large Codebases

As your project grows:

- More developers touch the same files.

- Understanding old code becomes harder.

- Bugs sneak in from wrong assumptions.

```ts
function updateProfile(user: User) { ... }
```

*TypeScript documents your assumptions and forces contracts, making it easier for future devs to understand and extend the code.*

4. Refactoring with Confidence

Imagine changing a function parameter in a large codebase.

- JavaScript: No idea where it breaks ‚Äî risky!

- TypeScript: Instantly shows all impacted places with clear errors.

*TypeScript gives you confidence to refactor code safely, even in huge projects.*

5. Supports Modern JavaScript Features + Extra Power

Works with ES6+ syntax

Also adds:

- Interfaces

- Enums

- Access modifiers (`private`, `public`)

- Generics

- Type inference

```ts
interface Animal {
  name: string;
  speak(): void;
}
```
*TypeScript is a super-set of JavaScript. You write modern JS + types.*

6. Easier Collaboration in Teams

With TypeScript:

- Everyone knows what inputs/outputs a function expects.

- Fewer bugs due to strict contracts.

```ts
function getUser(id: number): Promise<User> {
  ...
}
```
*Makes onboarding new devs easier and improves team coding standards.*

<summary>What are interfaces vs type aliases? When to use each?</summary>

What is an Interface?

An `interface` defines the shape of an object ‚Äî like a contract.

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Amber",
  age: 25,
};
```
*Best for `object` shapes, `class` contracts, and extending other `interfaces`.*

What is a Type Alias?

A `type` can do everything an `interface` can (almost) ‚Äî plus more.

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```
*Best for primitive `unions`, `tuples`, `functions`, and combining types.*

```ts
type ID = string | number;
type Point = [number, number];
type UserFunction = (user: User) => void;
```

Key Differences:

| Feature                     | `interface`                     | `type`                         |
| --------------------------- | -----------------------------   | -----------------------------  |
| Extending other types       | ‚úÖ Can extend other interfaces | ‚úÖ Can use intersections (`&`) |
| Reopening / merging         | ‚úÖ Yes (declaration merging)   | ‚ùå No (type can‚Äôt be reopened) |
| Unions / Intersections      | ‚ùå No unions                   | ‚úÖ Can do union & intersection |
| Better for classes          | ‚úÖ Yes (implements)            | ‚ö†Ô∏è Works, but not idiomatic    |
| Functions / tuples / unions | ‚ùå Not directly supported      | ‚úÖ Yes                         |
| Declaration merging         | ‚úÖ Yes                         | ‚ùå No                          |

Declaration Merging Example (Interface Only)

```ts
interface Dog {
  bark: () => void;
}

interface Dog {
  name: string;
}

// Merged version:
const dog: Dog = {
  name: "Tommy",
  bark: () => console.log("Woof!"),
};
```

Type aliases ‚ùå don‚Äôt allow this. If you do:

```ts
type Dog = { bark: () => void };
type Dog = { name: string }; // ‚ùå Error: Duplicate identifier 'Dog'
```

When to Use What

Use `interface` when:

- You're describing `object` shapes

- You're working with classes (implements)

- You need declaration merging

- You want to extend multiple `objects` cleanly

Use type when:

- You need `union` or `intersection`

```ts
type Status = "success" | "error";
```

- You‚Äôre defining `functions`, `tuples`, or `primitives`

- You need to combine different shapes using `&` and `|`

```ts
type Admin = User & { role: "admin" };
```

<details>

<summary>What are generics in TypeScript?</summary>

Generics are a way to create reusable components that work with any data type, while still keeping type safety.

Think of it like a placeholder for a type:

```ts
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}
```

Here, `T` is a generic type variable ‚Äî a placeholder for whatever type gets passed in.

Why Use Generics?

- Reusability: One function/type can work with many types.

- Type Safety: The compiler ensures types are correct.

- Flexibility: Avoid duplicating code for each type (`string`, `number`, etc).

Without Generics (Not Type-Safe)

```ts
function identity(value: any): any {
  return value;
}

const result = identity("Amber"); // ‚ùå result has type "any"
```
*We lose type information ‚Äî not ideal!*

With Generics (Type-Safe)

```ts
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}

const result = identity<string>("Amber"); // result: string
```
*Now the type is inferred and preserved.*

Real Reusable Generic Function Example

1. Generic Function to Wrap a Value

```ts
function wrapInArray<T>(value: T): T[] {
  return [value];
}

const numberArray = wrapInArray(5); // number[]
const stringArray = wrapInArray("hello"); // string[]
```
2. Generic Function to Filter Items by Type

```ts
function filterItems<T>(items: T[], predicate: (item: T) => boolean): T[] {
  return items.filter(predicate);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const even = filterItems(numbers, num => num % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
```

3. Generic Function to Merge Two Objects

```ts
function merge<T, U>(obj1: T, obj2: U): T & U {
  return { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
}

const merged = merge({ name: "Amber" }, { age: 25 });
// type: { name: string; age: number }
```

Generics in Arrow Function Form:

```ts
const identity = <T>(value: T): T => value;
```

<details>
<summary>How does TypeScript infer types automatically?</summary>

TypeScript is known for its powerful type inference system, which allows you to write clean, minimal code without manually annotating types everywhere ‚Äî yet still enjoy full type safety.

**What is Type Inference?**

TypeScript automatically infers (guesses) the type of a variable, function return, parameter, or expression based on how it‚Äôs used ‚Äî without requiring explicit type annotations.

How TypeScript Infers Types ‚Äî Common Scenarios:

1. Variable Declarations

```ts
let name = "Amber"; // inferred as string
let count = 42;     // inferred as number
```

TypeScript assigns `string` to name and `number` to count automatically.

2. Function Return Types

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}
```
Even without an explicit return type, TS infers `add` returns a `number`.

```ts
// Inferred: (a: number, b: number) => number
```

3. Arrays and Objects

```ts
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
// Type: string[]

let user = {
  name: "Amber",
  age: 25,
};
// Type: { name: string; age: number }
```
4. Destructuring

```ts
const person = { name: "Amber", age: 25 };
const { name, age } = person;
// name: string, age: number
```

5. Function Parameters from Context:

```ts
const users = ["Amber", "Khan"];

users.forEach((user) => {
  // user: string (inferred from array)
});
```
6. Generics and Type Propagation

```ts
function wrapInArray<T>(value: T): T[] {
  return [value];
}

const result = wrapInArray("hello");
// inferred T = string ‚Üí result: string[]
```

7. Best Common Type

TypeScript finds the ‚Äúbest common type‚Äù when dealing with multiple elements:

```ts
let mixed = [1, 2, "three"];
// inferred type: (string | number)[]
```

When Inference Might Not Work:

```ts
let data; // inferred as `any` ‚Äî no type information
data = 123;
data = "hello";
```

To avoid `any`, always initialize variables or add explicit types.

Why It Matters

- üßπ Less boilerplate: You don‚Äôt need to type everything.

- üß† Smarter editor: Auto-complete, refactor suggestions, etc.

- üõ°Ô∏è Type-safe without manual typing.

- üêû Fewer bugs: TypeScript catches mismatches early.

</details>

## 5. What is the unknown type? How is it different from any?

In TypeScript, both any and unknown are top types ‚Äî meaning they can hold any value. However, their behavior is very different in terms of type safety and intent.

`any` vs `unknown` ‚Äî Summary Table:

| Feature               | `any`                               | `unknown`                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Accepts any value     | Yes                                 | Yes                                                |
| Allows any operations | Yes (unsafe)                        | No (must first narrow or assert)                   |
| Type safety           | Completely bypasses type checking   | Enforces type checks                               |
| Use case              | Legacy, escape hatch                | Safer alternative to `any` for unknown values      |
| Type assignability    | Can be assigned to anything         | Cannot be assigned to more specific types directly |
| Recommended?          | Use only if you must                | Safer for dynamic or external input                |

`any`: Disables Type Checking:

```ts
let value: any;

value = 10;
value = "hello";

value.toUpperCase();  // ‚úÖ No error at compile time
value.notAFunction(); // ‚úÖ No error (but may crash at runtime)
```
*`any` disables TypeScript‚Äôs safety ‚Äî it‚Äôs like writing plain JavaScript.*

`unknown`: Safe, But Strict:

```ts
let value: unknown;

value = 10;
value = "hello";

value.toUpperCase();  // ‚ùå Error: Object is of type 'unknown'
```
*To safely use `unknown`, you must narrow or assert the type:*

Narrowing using `typeof`:

```ts
if (typeof value === "string") {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // ‚úÖ OK now
}
```
Type assertion:

```ts
console.log((value as string).toUpperCase()); // ‚úÖ OK
```

**When to Use unknown:**

Use unknown when:

- You're dealing with user input or external API responses.

- You want to defer type checking until you know more.

- You want a safer alternative to any.

**When any Is Okay (but risky):**

Use any only when:

- You're migrating from JS and need a quick fix.

- You want to silence TypeScript temporarily (not recommended).

- You‚Äôre using a third-party library with no types and can't fix it yet.

## 6. What are utility types like Partial, Pick, Omit, Record, Readonly?

Great! Utility types in TypeScript are built-in helpers that allow you to transform existing types in flexible ways. They're super useful in real-world code to avoid duplication, make types optional, required, or readonly, and compose complex types cleanly.

Here's a quick overview of the most used utility types:

| Utility Type   | Purpose                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Partial<T>`   | Makes **all properties optional**                           |
| `Required<T>`  | Makes **all properties required**                           |
| `Readonly<T>`  | Makes **all properties readonly**                           |
| `Pick<T, K>`   | Creates a type with **only selected keys**                  |
| `Omit<T, K>`   | Creates a type with **selected keys removed**               |
| `Record<K, T>` | Creates a type with **keys of type K and values of type T** |


1. üîπ Partial<T>

Makes all properties in type T optional.

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const updateUser = (user: Partial<User>) => {
  // all props are optional
  if (user.name) console.log(user.name);
};
```
*Useful when you only want to update part of an object.*

2. üîπ Required<T>

Makes all properties in T required (even optional ones).

```ts
interface Settings {
  darkMode?: boolean;
  language?: string;
}

const saveSettings = (config: Required<Settings>) => {
  // config.darkMode and config.language are guaranteed
};
```
*Useful to enforce full object construction.*

3. üîπ Readonly<T>

Makes all properties in T read-only (immutable).

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

const user: Readonly<User> = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Amber",
};

user.name = "Ali"; // ‚ùå Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property
```
*Great for immutability and avoiding accidental changes.*

4. üîπ Pick<T, K>

Creates a type by picking specific keys from a type.

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

type BasicInfo = Pick<User, "id" | "name">;

const user: BasicInfo = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Amber",
};
```
*Useful for extracting just what you need.*

5. üîπ Omit<T, K>

Creates a type by removing certain keys.

```ts
type WithoutEmail = Omit<User, "email">;

const user: WithoutEmail = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Amber",
};
```
*Useful for hiding fields like passwords or internal fields.*

6. üîπ Record<K, T>

Creates a type with keys K and values of type T.

```ts
type Role = "admin" | "user" | "guest";

const permissions: Record<Role, string[]> = {
  admin: ["read", "write", "delete"],
  user: ["read", "write"],
  guest: ["read"],
};
```
*Useful for mapping keys to consistent value types.*

## 7. Explain enum usage in TypeScript.

What is an Enum?

In TypeScript, an enum is a special type that defines a set of named constants.
It‚Äôs often used when you have a fixed set of related values that you want to refer to by name instead of using raw numbers or strings.

Think of it like giving human-readable names to values.

Why use enums?

- Improves readability ‚Üí avoids ‚Äúmagic numbers‚Äù or random strings in your code.

- Helps with type safety ‚Üí prevents assigning invalid values.

- Makes refactoring easier ‚Üí if you change a value, you only update it in one place.

Enum Types in TypeScript

a) Numeric Enums (default)

If you don‚Äôt assign values, numeric enums start from 0 by default.

```ts
enum Direction {
  Up,     // 0
  Down,   // 1
  Left,   // 2
  Right,  // 3
}

let move: Direction = Direction.Up;
console.log(move); // 0
```
You can also start from a custom number:

```ts
enum Status {
  Success = 200,
  NotFound = 404,
  ServerError = 500,
}
```
b) String Enums

Every member gets a string value (no auto-increment here).

```ts
enum Role {
  Admin = "ADMIN",
  User = "USER",
  Guest = "GUEST",
}

function checkRole(role: Role) {
  if (role === Role.Admin) {
    console.log("Welcome Admin!");
  }
}

checkRole(Role.Admin); // ‚úÖ "Welcome Admin!"
```
c) Heterogeneous Enums (mix numbers & strings ‚Äî rarely used)

```ts
enum Mixed {
  No = 0,
  Yes = "YES",
}
```
*Usually avoided for clarity.*

Reverse Mapping (only for numeric enums)

```ts
enum Color {
  Red = 1,
  Green,
  Blue,
}

console.log(Color.Red);   // 1
console.log(Color[1]);    // "Red" (reverse lookup)
```
*Reverse mapping doesn‚Äôt work for string enums.*

Const Enums (Performance optimization)

const enum is removed at compile time, inlining the value directly.
This means no extra object is created in JavaScript ‚Üí smaller, faster code.

```ts
const enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
}

let move = Direction.Up; // compiled directly to `0` in JS
```
When to Use Enums

‚úÖ Good for:

- Directions (North, South, East, West)

- HTTP status codes

- User roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer)

- Fixed states in an app (loading, success, error)

*Enums in TypeScript let you define a set of named constants for better readability and type safety. They can be numeric, string-based, or const enums for performance.*


## 8. How do you use as const, and what does it do?

Alright ‚Äî as const in TypeScript is a little keyword with a big impact.
Let‚Äôs break it down so you can explain it in interviews and use it correctly in code.

1Ô∏è‚É£ What does as const do?

It tells TypeScript to:

- Make the value completely immutable (deeply readonly).

- Infer the most specific literal type instead of a broader type.

Without as const

```ts
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
// Type: string[]

const direction = "north";
// Type: string
```
Here:

- `colors` is inferred as a general `string[]`.

- `direction` is inferred as a general `string`.

With `as const`

```ts
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"] as const;
// Type: readonly ["red", "green", "blue"]

const direction = "north" as const;
// Type: "north"
```

Now:

- The array is readonly and keeps literal values `"red" | "green" | "blue"`.

- `direction` is the literal type `"north"`, not just `string`.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Why is this useful?

a) Literal type inference

If you‚Äôre defining fixed values and want to keep their exact values as types:

```ts
const ROLES = ["admin", "user", "guest"] as const;
type Role = typeof ROLES[number];
// "admin" | "user" | "guest"
```

b) Immutable configuration objects

```ts
const CONFIG = {
  apiUrl: "https://api.example.com",
  timeout: 5000,
} as const;

// CONFIG.apiUrl = "newUrl"; ‚ùå Error: Readonly
```

c) Safer comparisons

```ts
const DIRECTIONS = ["up", "down", "left", "right"] as const;

function move(dir: typeof DIRECTIONS[number]) {
  console.log(`Moving ${dir}`);
}

move("up");    // ‚úÖ
move("forward"); // ‚ùå Type error
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways

- Locks in the exact values (no widening to string or number).

- Makes properties deeply readonly.

- Great for constants, configs, and union type generation.

- Avoids accidental changes at runtime and gives TypeScript more safety.


## 9. What is never and when does it occur?

1Ô∏è‚É£ What is `never`?

- `never` is a special type that represents no possible value.

- It means: ‚ÄúThis code path should be impossible‚Äù.

If something has the type `never`, it cannot be assigned any value ‚Äî not even `null` or `undefined`.

2Ô∏è‚É£ When does `never` occur?

a) Functions that never return

If a function throws an error or loops forever, its return type is `never` because it will never successfully finish.

```ts
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while (true) {}
}
```
b) Exhaustiveness checking

In type narrowing with `switch` or `if` statements, `never` is used to ensure all cases are handled.

```ts
type Shape = { kind: "circle"; radius: number }
           | { kind: "square"; side: number };

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case "square":
      return shape.side * shape.side;
    default:
      // Here shape is of type `never`
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape; // ‚ùå Error if a case is missing
      return _exhaustiveCheck;
  }
}
```
This ensures that if you later add `{ kind: "triangle" }`,

TypeScript will force you to update the `switch`.

c) Impossible type intersections

If you intersect types that can never be true together, the result is `never`.

```ts
type A = string & number; // never
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Why is never useful?

- Prevents unreachable code paths from being ignored.

- Helps catch missing cases during type narrowing.

- Improves type safety in exhaustive checks.

## 10. How do you handle type narrowing and type guards?

What is Type Narrowing?

Type narrowing is when TypeScript reduces a union type into a more specific type based on runtime checks.

For example:

```ts
function printLength(value: string | string[]) {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    // Here: value is string
    console.log(value.length);
  } else {
    // Here: value is string[]
    console.log(value.length);
  }
}
```
*Initially value is `string | string[]`,*
*but after `typeof value === "string"`,*
*TS narrows it to just `string`.*

2Ô∏è‚É£ What are Type Guards?

Type guards are conditions (functions or expressions) that tell TypeScript ‚ÄúHey, if we pass this check, the type is definitely X‚Äù.

Built-in Type Guards

`typeof` ‚Äî for primitives

```ts
if (typeof value === "string") { /* narrowed to string */ }
```

`instanceof` ‚Äî for classes/objects

```ts
if (date instanceof Date) { /* narrowed to Date */ }
```
`in` ‚Äî checks if a property exists

```ts
if ("radius" in shape) { /* narrowed to circle type */ }
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Handling with Exhaustiveness Checking

Type narrowing pairs really well with never to ensure all cases are handled.

```ts
type Shape = 
  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }
  | { kind: "square"; side: number };

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case "square":
      return shape.side * shape.side;
    default:
      const _exhaustive: never = shape; // Forces us to handle all types
      return _exhaustive;
  }
}
```

*Type narrowing is when TypeScript refines a broader type to a more specific type based on runtime checks. Type guards are the way we trigger narrowing, using built-in checks like `typeof`, `instanceof`, `in`, or custom functions returning `value is Type`. Combined with exhaustive checks, they help make code safer and prevent missing cases.*

## 11. Write a function `mergeObjects<T, U>(obj1: T, obj2: U): T & U` that merges two objects.

```ts
function mergeObjects<T, U>(obj1: T, obj2: U): T & U {
  return { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
}

// Example usage:
const objA = { name: "Amber", age: 25 };
const objB = { isAdmin: true, country: "India" };

const merged = mergeObjects(objA, objB);

/*
merged has type:
{
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isAdmin: boolean;
  country: string;
}
*/

console.log(merged);
// Output: { name: 'Amber', age: 25, isAdmin: true, country: 'India' }
```
- `T` is the type of `obj1`.

- `U` is the type of `obj2`.

- The return type `T & U` means:

  - The merged object will have all properties from `obj1` (T)

  - and all properties from `obj2` (U).
