## 1. Why did your app break in production due to JavaScript?

A lot of JavaScript production failures boil down to type safety gaps, runtime assumptions, and environment differences that werenâ€™t caught during development.

Here are some common real-world reasons an app breaks in production:

1. Type mismatches (no compile-time guarantee)

If youâ€™re using plain JavaScript (or TypeScript without strict checks), you might pass wrong data shapes.
Example:

```ts
// Expecting user.name to be a string
console.log(user.name.toUpperCase()); // ðŸ’¥ user.name is undefined in prod data
```
Why it happens in prod:

- API response changes (backend returns null or different field name).

- Test data in dev is perfect, but real prod data is messy.

2. Uncaught runtime errors

JavaScript doesnâ€™t stop execution when you call an undefined methodâ€”it crashes that flow.
Example:

```ts
if (user.isAdmin) {
  user.promote(); // ðŸ’¥ promote is not defined
}
```
Why it happens in prod:

- Certain users donâ€™t have that method/field.

- Code paths not tested in dev.

3. Asynchronous race conditions

Network calls resolve in a different order in production because of latency.

```ts
fetchUser();
fetchSettings();
// Settings overwrote user config because fetch order was different in prod
```
4. Using browser-specific APIs

Some APIs exist in Chrome dev tools but not in other browsers or Node.js.

```ts
navigator.clipboard.writeText("copy"); // ðŸ’¥ Fails in Safari without permission
```

5. Environment variable/config issues

- In dev, process.env.API_URL is set, but in prod itâ€™s missing or wrong.

- Code assumes NODE_ENV === "production" but build config strips it.

6. Implicit type coercion bugs

```ts
const count = "5" + 1; // "51" not 6
```
*In production, data comes as strings from APIs and gets concatenated instead of summed*

7. Mutating shared state

```ts
const config = { theme: "dark" };
function changeTheme(c) { c.theme = "light"; }
changeTheme(config); // Mutates everywhere
```
*This can cause hidden bugs that only appear after many interactions.*

8. Missing null/undefined checks

```ts
user.address.city.toLowerCase(); // ðŸ’¥ Cannot read properties of undefined
```
*TypeScript with `strictNullChecks` can prevent this.*


How to avoid these:

- Use TypeScript with strict mode.

- Validate runtime data with libraries like `zod` or `io-ts`.

- Add error boundaries and `try/catch` in async code.

- Use integration tests with real API data.

- Freeze configs with `as const` to avoid accidental mutations.
